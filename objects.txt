
Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript?

*An object is a non-primitive, structured data type in JavaScript. Objects are same as variables in JavaScript,
 the only difference is that an object holds multiple values in terms of properties and methods.

* Creating Objects in JavaScript:
    1) By object literal
    2) By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword)

* By object literal

     syntax :

      object = {property1:value1,property2:value2} 

      Property and value is separated by colon(:).

 *  By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword)     
      
      example:

      var myCar = new Object();
      myCar.make = 'Ford';
      myCar.model = 'Mustang';
      myCar.year = 1969;

 * To accsess javascript objects
 
     objectName.property or objectName[“property”]
