
Difference between http1.1 and http 2 ?

http1.1

   * It is used to process text commands to complete request reponse cycles.
   * It loads resources one after the other,if one resource cannot be loaded,it blocks all the other resources
     behind it.
   * In HTTP/1.1 headers in every request are sent uncompressed on the network.
   * It loads a single request for every TCP connection

http2
    * It uses binary commands to complete request response cycles.
    *  HTTP2 is fully multiplexed, instead of ordered and blocking
    *  HTTP2 can, therefore, use one connection for parallelism
    *  HTTP2 uses header compression to reduce overhead
    *  HTTP2 allows servers to “push” responses proactively into client caches
